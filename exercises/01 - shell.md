# Beginning Python - Exercises

## Exercise 1: the interactive shell

Start the Python interactive shell, either by writing `python3` on a command
prompt somewhere, or by opening a shell in your IDE.

Now try out a number of things.

* What's `724 + 1918`? (That is, write `724 + 1918` and hit Enter.)
* What's `100 - 23.5`?
* What's `16 ** 4`?
* What's `1969 % 100`?

What happens when you do `math.sqrt(18)`? Try first doing `import math` and
then computing the square root again.

What happens when you do `math.sqrt(-18)`?

Try doing `dir(math)` to see what other functions the `math` module contains.
Write `help(math.sqrt)` for the documentation for the `sqrt` function. Do the
same for at least one other function in the `math` module.

If you were unsure what the `str.upper` method does, what would you write? If
you were unsure what this method was called, what would you write? Try it. Also
try to use the method, with something like `'abc'.upper()`.

## Exercise 5: Printing a list of guests

* Make a list of the following five guests, and put it in a variable `guests`:
    * 'Mr. Ratchett'
    * 'Mr. Bouc'
    * 'Mrs. Hubbard'
    * 'Mr. Michel'
    * 'Miss Ohlsson'
* Make a `for` loop that prints all five names in the `guest` list.
* Before the `for` loop, use `guests.append` to add a `'Mr. Foscarelli'` to the
  list.
* Find ways, using the slice syntax, to print:
    * Just the first three names of the list.
    * Just the last two names of the list.
    * Every other name in the list.
